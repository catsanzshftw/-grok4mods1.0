"llm_history_since_1930": [
"Early precursors to large language models (LLMs) in the 1930s-1950s included Alan Turing's foundational work on computability in 1936, early machine learning concepts like Arthur Samuel’s checkers program in the 1950s, and the Mark 1 Perceptron in 1958 as the first artificial neural network.",
"The 1960s-1980s saw the development of the first NLP program ELIZA in 1966, SHRDLU in 1970, followed by AI winters, but advancements in small language models for word prediction at IBM in the 1980s and statistical models in the late 1980s.",
"The 1990s-2010s introduced deep learning in the 1990s, Word2Vec in 2013, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in 2014, RNNs and LSTMs, leading to the Transformer architecture in 2017, GPT-1 in 2018, BERT in 2018, XLNet in 2019, GPT-2 in 2019, and T5 in 2019.",
"The early 2020s exploded with GPT-3 in 2020, GPT-Neo in 2021, GPT-J in 2021, Megatron-Turing NLG in 2021, Ernie 3.0 Titan in 2021, Claude in 2021, GLaM in 2021, Gopher in 2021, LaMDA in 2022, GPT-NeoX in 2022, Chinchilla in 2022, PaLM in 2022, BLOOM in 2022, OPT in 2022, and ChatGPT based on GPT-3.5 in 2022.",
"From 2023 to 2025, advancements continued with LLaMA in 2023, GPT-4 in 2023, Falcon in 2023, PaLM 2 in 2023, Claude 2 in 2023, Mistral in 2023, Mixtral in 2023, Grok-1 in 2023, Phi in 2023, Vicuna in 2023, OpenChatKit in 2023, Gemma in 2024, Claude 3 in 2024, Command R in 2024, Code Llama in 2024, Llama 2 in 2024, Google Gemini in 2024, Grok-1.5 in 2024, Grok-2 in 2024, Qwen in 2024, Stable LM in 2024, xLSTM in 2024, YaLM in 2024, Yi in 2024, Grok-3 in 2025, Grok-4 in 2025, and DeepSeek-R1 in 2025, focusing on larger scales, open-source alternatives, and multimodal integrations."
